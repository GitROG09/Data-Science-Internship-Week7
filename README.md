# 💡 Features / Highlights
## Hands-On

Calculated mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for sales data.

Plotted sales distributions using histograms and density plots.

Performed t-tests to compare sales between groups (e.g., Before vs After campaigns).

Calculated correlations between marketing spend and sales.

Computed confidence intervals for key business metrics.

## Project

Conducted a full statistical analysis on business data.

Tested hypotheses on sales performance.

Visualized correlations and distributions.

Provided actionable business insights based on statistical evidence.

# 📈 How to Use

Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload the provided CSV dataset (or use the generated dataset in the notebook).

Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

Edit the dataset if you want to test with your own business data.

# 🔗 Dataset

A sample business dataset is included within the notebooks (sales_data.csv) (generated via code).

Columns include: Sales, Marketing_Spend, Customer_Count, Discount, Region.
